Piezo
=====

These example uses a piezo speaker to play melodies and detect knocks.

It sends a square wave of the appropriate frequency to the piezo, generating the corresponding tone and listens to analog inputs.  

###Piezo as output:  

- drunk_rider.ino 
- rocky.ino

Thanks to [Olive Christou](http://olivia-uhlig.me/) for figuring out the rocky melody and making the pauses better with me.
